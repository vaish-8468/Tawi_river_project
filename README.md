<p>Detecting the speed of Tawi River using Image processing and App Development</p>

<h3>Algorithm Used to calculate flow speed:</h3>
Optical Flow: Optical flow is the pattern of apparent motion of image objects between two consecutive frames caused by the movement of the object or camera. It is a 2D vector field where each vector is a displacement vector showing the movement of points from the first frame to the second. Optical flow works on several assumptions: The pixel intensities of an object do not change between consecutive frames. Neighboring pixels have similar motions.
